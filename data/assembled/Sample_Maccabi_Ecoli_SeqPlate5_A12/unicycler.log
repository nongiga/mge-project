Starting Unicycler (2020-12-10 23:33:28)
----------------------------------------
    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since you provided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-optimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig length and graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.
    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler

SPAdes read error correction (2020-12-10 23:33:44)
--------------------------------------------------
    Unicycler uses the SPAdes read error correction module to reduce the number of errors in the short read before SPAdes assembly. This can make the assembly faster and simplify the assembly graph structure.

Command: /media/kishonylab/KishonyStorage/noga/maccabi-snakemake/.snakemake/conda/83c318fa/bin/spades.py -1 /media/kishonylab/KishonyStorage/noga/MaccabiUTI/Mathews_processing/Filtered_data/Sample_Maccabi_Ecoli_SeqPlate5_A12/R1_combined.trimmed.fastq.gz -2 /media/kishonylab/KishonyStorage/noga/MaccabiUTI/Mathews_processing/Filtered_data/Sample_Maccabi_Ecoli_SeqPlate5_A12/R2_combined.trimmed.fastq.gz -o /media/kishonylab/KishonyStorage/noga/maccabi-snakemake/assembled/Sample_Maccabi_Ecoli_SeqPlate5_A12/spades_assembly/read_correction --threads 1 --only-error-correction

Choosing k-mer range for assembly (2020-12-10 23:57:02)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input reads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of finding an ideal assembly.

SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127
Median read length: 126
K-mer range: 25, 43, 59, 73, 83, 93, 101, 107, 113, 119


SPAdes assemblies (2020-12-10 23:57:18)
---------------------------------------
    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the assembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and the number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)), where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.

K-mer   Contigs   Dead ends   Score   
   25                           failed
   43                           failed

Determining graph multiplicity (2020-12-11 00:20:28)
----------------------------------------------------
    Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlying sequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only once in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.

Cleaning graph (2020-12-11 00:20:28)
------------------------------------
    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove overlaps and simplify the graph structure. The end result is a graph ready for bridging.

Graph overlaps removed

Removed zero-length segments:
    129

Merged small segments:
    133, 134

    Unicycler now selects a set of anchor contigs from the single-copy contigs. These are the contigs which will be connected via bridges to form the final assembly.

57 anchor segments (4,845,490 bp) out of 131 total segments (4,986,893 bp)


Creating SPAdes contig bridges (2020-12-11 00:20:28)
----------------------------------------------------
    SPAdes uses paired-end information to perform repeat resolution (RR) and produce contigs from the assembly graph. SPAdes saves the graph paths corresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these paths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from the path.

                                     Bridge
Start          Path         End     quality
  -41          120          48         58.6
  -16                       38         62.2

Creating loop unrolling bridges (2020-12-11 00:20:28)
-----------------------------------------------------
    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig of a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e. the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the middle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and makes a bridge.

No loop unrolling bridges made


Applying bridges (2020-12-11 00:20:28)
--------------------------------------
    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality. This ensures that when multiple, contradictory bridges exist, the most supported option is used.

Bridge type   Start -> end   Path        Quality
SPAdes           2 -> -61                 63.134
SPAdes         -16 -> 38                  62.234
SPAdes          27 -> 22                  62.085
SPAdes          41 -> 54     124          60.009
SPAdes         -41 -> 48     120          58.625
SPAdes          -6 -> 9                   58.208

Bridged assembly graph (2020-12-11 00:20:29)
--------------------------------------------
    The assembly is now mostly finished and no more structural changes will be made. Ideally the assembly graph should now have one contig per replicon and no erroneous contigs (i.e a complete assembly). If there are more contigs, then the assembly is not complete.
